**Title:** Vigenère Cipher Triumph

---

**Description:**
In this example, we encounter a Vigenère cipher, a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that employs a varying shift for each character. Our task is to decipher the encoded message and uncover the key used for encryption. To accomplish this, we investigate the website google.com, specifically focusing on the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button. After several attempts, we discover the key "rnmpx" within the division class of this button.

After unraveling the encryption, we unveil the final password: "congratulations, you have triumphed, emerged victorious, defeating the unfathomable forces of encryption. your skills, your relentless pursuit of knowledge, and your unwavering determination have led you to this moment, this glorious moment of triumph. your key to success and the password is the_fun_has_only_begun."
